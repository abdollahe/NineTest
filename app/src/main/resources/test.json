There is a parallel with what we've seen in the US in the last 7 days, and what has transpired in Australia this week.&nbsp;In the US, it was US Federal Reserve Chairperson Jerome Powell wilting under the pressure of Wall Street in his bid to normalise interest rates.

Below is a story from Associated Press about what is expected to happen.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>After two years of bitter partisanship and personal attacks, President Donald Trump will call for unity and cross-party cooperation in Washington during Tuesday's State of the Union address, a message likely to ring hollow with Democrats determined to block his push for a border wall.</p>\n\n<p>Trump's prime-time address comes at a critical moment in his presidency. He pushed his party into a lengthy government shutdown over border security, only to cave to Democrats. With another shutdown deadline looming, the president has few options for getting Congress to fund a border wall, and he risks further alienating his party if he tries to circumvent lawmakers by declaring a national emergency instead.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Trump was not expected to issue the emergency declaration in his speech</strong>, in part because he's aware of GOP opposition and wants to avoid being booed in the House chamber. Still, the president planned to hammer his case that the situation at the southern border represents a security crisis for Americans.</p>\n\n<p>\"No issue better illustrates the divide between America's working class and America's political class than illegal immigration,\" Trump will say, <strong>according to excerpts released ahead of his address</strong>. \"Wealthy politicians and donors push for open borders while living their lives behind walls and gates and guards.\"</p>\n\n<p>As he stands before lawmakers, the president will be surrounded by symbols of his emboldened political opposition. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who was praised by Democrats for her hard-line negotiating during the shutdown, will sit behind the president as he speaks. Some Democratic women will be wearing white, the color favored by early 20th-century suffragettes. And several senators running for president will be in the audience, including Sens. Kamala Harris of California and Cory Booker of New Jersey.</p>\n\n<p>For a time, it was unclear if Trump's annual address to Congress would happen. He'd been scheduled to speak to lawmakers last week, but Pelosi forced him to postpone while the shutdown persisted. White House officials said Trump planned to highlight areas where he believes he can work with Democrats, including infrastructure and prescription drug pricing.</p>\n\n<p>While Trump was still putting the final touches on the speech Tuesday afternoon, he was expected to use some of his televised address to showcase a growing economy. D<strong>espite the shutdown, the U.S. economy added a robust 304,000 jobs in January, marking 100 straight months of job growth</strong>. That's the longest such period on record.</p>\n\n<p>Trump and his top aides have also hinted that he is likely to use the address to announce a major milestone in the fight against the Islamic State group in Syria. Despite the objections of some advisers, Trump announced in December that he was withdrawing U.S. forces in Syria.</p>\n\n<p>In a weekend interview with CBS, Trump said efforts to defeat the IS group were \"at 99 percent right now. We'll be at 100.\" Foreign policy has been another area where Republicans have increasingly been willing to distance themselves from the president. Several leading GOP lawmakers have sharply criticized his plans to withdraw from Syria, as well as from Afghanistan. Trump, in excerpts of his address, defended his moves, declaring: \"Great nations do not fight endless wars.\"</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
